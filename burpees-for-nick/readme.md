# Burpees For Nick

We're doing a going away HIIT workout for our awesome QA Engineer Nick. This wee web app will let you do burpees in honor of his departure!

Enter the number of minutes you want to burpee for and then try and do that many burpees per minute.  Easy at first, but anything above 5 or 8 minutes and it gets harder and harder. After each minute a beep will play. At the end of the allotted time, a lot of beep will play!

Thanks Nick!
